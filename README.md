## Introduction

CNN Image Classifier is a tool for image classification via Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). 
Developed using Python & deep learning libraries (OpenCV, TensorFlow, Keras).

This image classifier uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) & deep learning for efficient classification. It effectively distinguishes between "happy" & "sad" images, performing on datasets sourced from Google Images.

🚧 Please Note: This project is a work in progress and under active development. 🚧


## Key Features

- 🌐 CNN Models: Built using TensorFlow and Keras for cutting-edge neural network architectures.
- 🖼️ Comprehensive Image Processing: Integrated with OpenCV for advanced image manipulation and preprocessing.
- 📊 In-Depth Data Visualization: Utilizes Matplotlib for insightful data analysis and model performance visualization.
- 📈 Performance Metrics: Employs Scikit-learn for detailed evaluation metrics and analysis.

## Roadmap (TODO)
- [X] Adding more training data for a properly distributed split
- [ ] Hosting training data on LFS
- [ ] Expanding classification beyond "happy" and "sad"
