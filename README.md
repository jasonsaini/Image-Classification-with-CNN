## Introduction

CNN Image Classifier is a tool for image classification via Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). 
Developed using Python & deep learning libraries, this project aims to provide accurate and efficient image classification. 

Tested across various datasets pulled from Google Images search, it demonstrates robust performance in distinguishing whether an image is "happy" or "sad".

This model is currently trained on human faces, and much more data needs to be pulled in as a result.

🚧 Please Note: This project is a work in progress and under active development. 🚧


## Key Features

- 🌐 Advanced CNN Models: Built using TensorFlow and Keras for cutting-edge neural network architectures.
- 🖼️ Comprehensive Image Processing: Integrated with OpenCV for advanced image manipulation and preprocessing.
- 📊 In-Depth Data Visualization: Utilizes Matplotlib for insightful data analysis and model performance visualization.
- 📈 Performance Metrics: Employs Scikit-learn for detailed evaluation metrics and analysis.

## Roadmap (TODO)
- [ ] Adding more training data for a properly distributed split
- [ ] Hosting training data on LFS
- [ ] Expanding classification beyond "happy" and "sad"
