Introduction
CNN Image Classifier is a tool for image classification via Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). 
Developed using Python & deep learning libraries, this project aims to provide accurate and efficient image classification. Tested across various datasets, it demonstrates robust performance in distinguishing whether an image is "happy" or "sad".
This model is currently trained on human faces, and much more data needs to be pulled in as a result.
